# GM_Spatial_Correlation
Some Stan and INLA models to estimate ground-motion models including spatial correlations.
The INLA models, applied to the ITA18 data set (Lanzano et al, 2018), can be found at <https://nikuehn.github.io/GM_Spatial_Correlation/>.
The sim_spatcorr files contain Stan and Inla code for some simulated cases.
